            // 1. By default, on Ubuntu, when using sudo, $HOME is not changed to the selected user's homedir, but passed
            // on from the user invoking sudo (see https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/91572/38465)
            // 2. The nest command assumes it can read ~/.config file. Since $HOME is not changed to the homeassistant's
            // homedir as per item 1, it tries to read the homedir from the sensu user but using the homeassistant's
            // user's login. This fails (no permissions).
            // Since we don't really need the ~/.config file, we just set $HOME=/tmp to work around this
