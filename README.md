# casa
Set of ansible playbooks that I use to maintain my [homeassistant](home-assistant.io)-based home automation stack.

![HADashboard Preview](docs/images/Home.png)

I maintain this purely for fun (often favoring speed over quality) and really only with my own use-cases in mind,
so use at your own risk! I don't expect the actual code to work for anyone but me, so please consider this as more as a
reference rather than a plug-and-play solution.

You might see a reference here and there to ```casa-data```: this is a private repo I maintain that contains the actual
data relevant to my home (usernames, passwords, secrets, IP addresses, etc). The roles and playbooks in this repo all
use dummy defaults.
## Setup
### Hardware

Here's a list of gear I use that is integrated with casa:
- AppleTV
- Sonos play 5, play 1, play base
- Philips Hue light bulbs
- Ikea Tradfri light bulbs (and movement sensors, remote controls)
- iPad mini control planels
- Chromecast
- Nest Cam
- Nest Thermostat
- Nest Protect smoke detectors
- TP link HS100 Power Switch

Other gear I have that is currently not integrated in casa:
- Elgato Eve Window sensor
- Elgato Eve Power plug
- Amazon Echo dot

### Software Stack

The best way to get a quick overview of the software stack is to look at roles directory

Homeassistant
HADashboard


## Running ansible

### Prerequisites

Install dependencies (best globally):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### DEV
Development should be done locally in Vagrant.
```bash
vagrant up
ansible-playbook home.yml -i inventory/vagrant
# roofcam only
ansible-playbook home.yml -i inventory/vagrant --tags roofcam
# using production data
ansible-playbook home.yml -i  ~/repos/casa-data/inventory/vagrant
```
### PROD

This won't be useful to anyone else but me :-)

```bash
ansible-playbook --ask-pass --ask-sudo-pass home.yml -i ~/repos/casa-data/inventory/mbp-server
# roofcam only
ansible-playbook --ask-pass --ask-sudo-pass home.yml -i ~/repos/casa-data/inventory/mbp-server --tags roofcam
```

## Convenient commands

```bash
# Check logs
sudo journalctl -fu homeassistant@pi.service
# Restart server
sudo systemctl restart homeassistant@pi.service
```

# Tech specific bits
## InfluxDB:
```
export INFLUX_USERNAME="$(vault-get influxdb_admin_user)";export INFLUX_PASSWORD="$(vault-get influxdb_admin_password)"; 
echo "export INFLUX_USERNAME=\"$INFLUX_USERNAME\"; export INFLUX_PASSWORD=\"$INFLUX_PASSWORD\";"
influx -ssl --unsafeSsl -username "$INFLUX_USERNAME" -password "$INFLUX_PASSWORD"
# Examples
show grants for "<example user>";
```

## python-nest
```bash
source /opt/homeassistant/.venv/bin/activate
export NEST_CLIENT_ID=$(grep "nest:" -A 2 /opt/homeassistant/configuration.yaml  | awk '/client_id/{print $2}')
export NEST_CLIENT_SECRET=$(grep "nest:" -A 2 /opt/homeassistant/configuration.yaml  | awk '/client_secret/{print $2}')
nest --client-id $NEST_CLIENT_ID --client-secret $NEST_CLIENT_SECRET --token-cache /opt/homeassistant/nest.conf --index 0 camera-show
```

## grafana

Database location: /var/lib/grafana/grafana.db


# Miscellaneous notes

## Upgrading homeassistant

When upgrading homeassistant, you need to manually start it because on first run hass will install a bunch of additional packages.
Especially installing pyatv tends to take 10+ mins.

Try running
```bash
ps -ef | grep pip
```
# Virtualbox performance issues
I keep running into vagrant box lock ups. Some details of research I've done around this:

https://joeshaw.org/terrible-vagrant-virtualbox-performance-on-mac-os-x/

```
export CASA_VM=$(VBoxManage list vms | grep casa_home | cut -f1 -d" " | tr -d "\"")
VBoxManage storagectl $CASA_VM --name "IDE" --hostiocache on
```

```
## SCP

scp -P 2222 -i ~/repos/casa/.vagrant/machines/home/virtualbox/private_key ubuntu@127.0.0.1:/home/ubuntu/redis.conf .

## Hass APIs
```bash
export HASS_URL="http://0.0.0.0:8123"; export HASS_PASSWORD="$(awk '/api_password: /{print $2}'  /opt/homeassistant/configuration.yaml)"
# Getting  entity picture
curl -s -H "x-ha-access: $HASS_PASSWORD" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $HASS_URL/api/states/camera.hallway | jq -r ".attributes.entity_picture"
```

## Sensu
Location of binary check scripts:
```
/opt/sensu/embedded/bin/check-ping.rb --help
```

Logs:
/var/log/sensu/*

Important note wrt sensu checks:
From https://sensuapp.org/docs/1.1/guides/getting-started/intro-to-checks.html#create-the-check-definition-for-cpu-metrics

By default, Sensu checks with an exit status code of 0 (for OK) do not create events unless they indicate a change in
state from a non-zero status to a zero status (i.e. resulting in a resolve action). Metric collection checks will output
metric data regardless of the check exit status code, however, they usually exit 0. To ensure events are always created
for a metric collection check, the check type of metric is used.


Things I don't like about sensu:
 - For standard checks, not all checks cause events, only if something goes wrong (see above)
 - No remediation included by default - hard to do event with plugins

### Lights
Color:

Tradfri white spectrum lamps support between 2200 (warm)  and 4000 (cold) Kelvin.
That *should* translate to 0-250 mireds (color_temp in hass), but that doesn't seem to be working
http://www.leefilters.com/lighting/mired-shift-calculator.html

Home-assistant does not allow you to change attributes (like kelvin/brightness) on a group of lights at a time yet
Even if they are exposed by Tradfri/Hue as a single light.

# TODO
- Groups: https://home-assistant.io/components/group/
- Samsung smartTV support: https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.samsungtv/
- Location tracking via OwnTracks
   -> This requires a DDNS, which means exposing everything to the web, which has security implications.
- https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.cast/
- Alexa support
- Calling "homeassistant/reload_core_config" one config reload instead of doing a HA restart
- Force state update on Nest after changing state through python-nest command
- Metrics dashboard (logstash)
- Improve roofcam accuracy
- sonos-node-http-api: SSL & auth
- Better messaging in slack (also include lights + custom nest sensors)
- Backups: redis DB
- Backups: grafana dashboards
- Backups: auto-copy to Samba share
- Sensu: inlfuxdb checks
- sudo askpass program lastpass
- limit speedtest.net CPU cycles using cgroups
- Smarter office lighting behavior (relax, etc -> don't turn off lights when working)
- HADashboard automatically go back to homescreen when no activity
- Use Flux to change light color in hallway depending on time of day: https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.flux/
- Upstairs scenes: packing, working

- Security:
    - Let's encrypt support
    - TLS everywhere: home-assistant, HADash, Spotify, Sensu, Uchiwa
    - iptable rules for all (just block all and then selectively allow),
        make sure base role wipes all other ip tables rules -> in case I manually set something, this should be undone

### Automation Ideas
- Cooking: If not watching TV & Music=NoPreset -> play music
- Cooking: If watching TV and cooking active for 1 hour -> disable cooking

- When pausing music -> set music preset to NoMusic

IN PROGRESS:

- When turn off kitchen lights -> stop cooking
- When setting goodnight -> automatically set cooking back to false

VALIDATED:


### Sensor ideas
- Refactor monit-hass-sensors to custom-hass-sensors so we can do more than just monit sensors
- Roofcam sensor (refactor monit-hass-sensors to be more generic)
- Car at home detect sensor based on image recognition
- Door/window sensors
- Upload/backups success sensor (based on Monit/other check)
- Custom nest sensors based on python-nest, because current nest sensors in Hass aren't very good
- Nest smoke detector checks integrated with sensu

### HADashboard
- HADashboard: Volume control
- HADashboard: Custom Nest Cam controls (incl enable-disable support + link to livestream)
- HADashboard: enlarge camera view on click (not so hard using custom JS)
- HADashboard: Custom weather widget
- Automatically go back to Home page after idle for x sec on a given page

# Old stuff (keeping here for reference)
## Monit

Getting status from monit using API
```bash
# Status
curl -u "$CASA_MONIT_USERNAME:$CASA_MONIT_PASSWORD" http://localhost:2812/_status
curl -u "$CASA_MONIT_USERNAME:$CASA_MONIT_PASSWORD" http://localhost:2812/_status?format=xml
# Summary
curl -u "$CASA_MONIT_USERNAME:$CASA_MONIT_PASSWORD" http://localhost:2812/_summary
```

## Installing Raspbian

Use [etcher.io](https://etcher.io) to flash raspbian lite to SD card.
Then add an empty 'ssh' file to the SD card to enable SSH on boot on Raspbian.
